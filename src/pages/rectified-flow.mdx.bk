## Introduction

Flow-based generative models transform a simple base distribution into a target distribution using a continuous-time dynamical system.
A basic form is:

$$
\frac{d x(t)}{dt} = v_\theta(x(t), t),
$$

where $v_\theta$ is a learned velocity field.

In practice, **curvature is computationally expensive**: curved trajectories typically require more solver steps to maintain accuracy.

## Background

The model defines a mapping from noise to data via integration.
A common numerical discretization with $N$ steps has complexity that scales with $N$.

## The Problem

If trajectories are highly curved, then stable simulation requires smaller step sizes.
This is why “straightening” paths can materially reduce sampling cost.
